    "Time dependent seasonal components refer to pattern in data that repeat at regular intervals over time such as daily weekly monthly or yearlyy cycles these patterns can vary in magnitiude or shape from one cycle to another making them independent on the specfic time period beings consider for examples sales of ice cream might increase during summer months and decrease during the winter months creating a seasonal pattern components are called time dependent are called because they change over timr influenced by various factors such as trends holidays or econmic condtions"
